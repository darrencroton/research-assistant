# Custom Daily and Weekly Templates

`re-ass` can use your own Markdown note templates, including templates stored in an Obsidian vault or any other notes directory.

The important point is that `re-ass` does not guess where to insert content. It updates specific sections identified by the heading text configured in `user_preferences/settings.toml`. If those headings are missing or renamed, `re-ass` appends its managed section at the end of the note instead of updating the place you intended.

## How template selection works

The default template paths are configured in:

- `user_preferences/settings.toml`

You can point these settings at any Markdown files you want:

```toml
[templates]
daily_template = "/path/to/your/daily-template.md"
weekly_template = "/path/to/your/weekly-template.md"
```

Those template files must already exist. Running the setup script will create default templates to get you going, but you'll probably want to customise things.

On first use, `re-ass` reads those template files and writes output notes into your configured output directories.

## Daily template requirements

Your daily template must contain the heading configured as `notes.daily_top_paper_heading`.

The current default is:

```markdown
## TODAY'S TOP PAPER
```

That section is where `re-ass` writes the selected top paper for the day.

Important details:

- Keep the heading text exact, including capitalisation.
- Anything under that specific heading is managed by `re-ass` and may be replaced.
- Content outside that heading is left alone.
- If the heading is missing, `re-ass` appends a fresh managed section at the end of the daily note.
- Automatic catch-up places missed batches onto earlier weekday notes, not onto every consecutive calendar day.

### Supported date placeholders

Daily templates can use:

- `{{date}}` for an ISO date such as `2026-03-23`
- `{{date:...}}` for a Pendulum format string such as `{{date:dddd Do MMMM YYYY}}`

### Example daily template

```markdown
# {{date:dddd Do MMMM YYYY}}

## Tasks

- 

## Notes

## TODAY'S TOP PAPER

## Journal
```

## Weekly template requirements

Your weekly template must contain the headings configured as `notes.weekly_synthesis_heading` and `notes.weekly_additions_heading`.

The current defaults are:

```markdown
## SYNTHESIS
## DAILY ADDITIONS
```

Important details:

- `re-ass` rewrites the first `#` title in the file to include the current week range; that visible heading is the source of truth for the note's week.
- The synthesis heading section is managed by `re-ass` and replaced with the current weekly synthesis.
- The daily additions heading section is managed by `re-ass` and updated with per-day paper entries such as `### Monday 23rd`.
- Content outside those sections is left alone.
- If one of those headings is missing, `re-ass` appends that managed section at the end of the weekly note.

### Example weekly template

```markdown
# ARXIV PAPERS FOR THE WEEK

## Goals

- 

## SYNTHESIS

---

## DAILY ADDITIONS

## Follow-up
```

The `---` separator is optional, but the built-in template uses it and it reads well.

## What `re-ass` will insert

### Daily note section

`re-ass` writes:

- a link to the top paper note
- the micro-summary for that paper with a trailing arXiv link
- a link back to the matching weekly note for that day, which may be the live weekly note or a weekly archive during catch-up

### Weekly note synthesis

`re-ass` rewrites a rolling synthesis for the current week from the full weekly additions gathered so far into the heading configured by `notes.weekly_synthesis_heading`.
The default word budget starts at 100 words and expands through the week to 200 words by the end of the note window.
The synthesis may use one short paragraph, multiple short paragraphs, bullets, or a mix, depending on which format best communicates the cross-paper themes clearly.
Only fully summarised papers are included in the synthesis input. Weekly overflow bullets are rendered in the saved note but do not drive the synthesis.

### Weekly daily additions

`re-ass` appends or updates day blocks under the heading configured by `notes.weekly_additions_heading`, for example:

```markdown
### Monday 23rd

**Title:** [[paper-note]]

**Summary:** Short summary here. [arXiv:2603.12345](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.12345)

**Other papers of interest:**

- "*Overflow paper title*", Surname A. et al., [arXiv:2603.12345](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.12345)
```

## Recommended workflow for Obsidian or another notes app

1. Keep your custom template files in your vault or notes directory.
2. Point `[templates]` in `user_preferences/settings.toml` at those files.
3. Set `[output].daily_notes_dir` and `[output].weekly_notes_dir` to folders you want to read from your notes app, or symlink the generated output directories into your vault.
4. Choose `notes.link_style = "wikilink"` for Obsidian-style links, or `notes.link_style = "markdown"` for standard Markdown links.

## Common mistakes

- Renaming the headings configured in `notes.daily_top_paper_heading`, `notes.weekly_synthesis_heading`, or `notes.weekly_additions_heading`
- Removing the first top-level `#` heading from the weekly template
- Putting important manual notes inside sections that `re-ass` manages
- Assuming the app uses invisible markers; it uses exact heading names instead

If you want a safe starting point, copy the built-in templates in this directory and modify everything except the managed headings, or update the heading settings at the same time.
